## EOS

Calculations were performed in 2 steps: `./coarse` contains 11 cells strained by up to +/- 2%, `./finer` contains cells strained by up to +/- 1%. The internal positions were relaxed after straining.

## Prerequisite

- `mlfftools` (https://github.com/flokno/tools.mlff) need be installed (v0.0.1) to provide the scripts to extract and fit EOS data
