## glp-results

Collect the data and scripts to make plots and tables in the paper. `data/` contains summary data collected from runs that are too large to check in directly, and `plots/` collects the scripts required to make plots (and also tables). `tbx/` contains helpers. To run scripts, `tbx` should be importable and a number of standard dependencies (`numpy matplotlib xarray` etc.) should be present.
